# Chunk-Close Review

## Context

`sdd-implement`'s TDD inner loop catches what tests test for, but misses
spec-implementation drift, forgotten traceability updates, and undocumented
deviations. In the rubric M1 cycle, 5 of 7 chunks needed rework after
external review caught issues the implementation session missed: model-name
drift, silent stubbing, wrong matching fields, missing logic, dead code.

This spec defines a structured review checklist that runs at each chunk
boundary, catching the most common failure modes before they ripple into
downstream chunks.

## Design

### Chunk Definition

A chunk is a contiguous group of tasks in the plan file marked by an
explicit `### Chunk N: <name>` header. Chunks are implementation work units
(~5-15 hours each), distinct from delivery milestones (M1, M2, etc. — see
milestone-plans.md).

```markdown
### Chunk 3: Reconciliation

**Goal**: Drift detection, gap reporting, bootstrap flow.

**Tasks**:
1. [implement] SPEC-RECON: reconciliation engine — traces to recon.md
2. [implement] Bootstrap interactive flow — traces to recon.md

**Entry criteria**: Chunk 2 complete.
**Exit criteria**: All 3 drift types detected in unit tests.
```

`sdd-plan` produces chunk headers; `sdd-implement` detects them via the
`### Chunk N:` pattern. The chunk number N is a sequential integer within
the plan file, starting at 0 or 1. Chunk names are descriptive prose.

**Why explicit headers rather than inferred grouping**: Implicit chunk
boundaries (e.g., every 3 tasks) are fragile — they change when tasks are
added or removed. Explicit headers make chunk boundaries a planning
decision, not an accident of ordering.

### Checklist

After completing all tasks in a chunk, `sdd-implement` executes these four
checks in order before reporting the chunk complete. Each check produces
findings classified as blocking or advisory per the tiered enforcement
rules.

#### Check 1: Spec-Implementation Type Alignment

**Input**: Spec files referenced by the chunk's tasks (identified via each
task's prose `traces to` reference).

**Process**:
1. For each referenced spec, extract data type definitions from markdown
   code blocks (fenced with `` ``` ``). Specifically:
   - **(a) Class names**: any `class Foo` or `class Foo(Base)` declaration
   - **(b) Field names**: lines matching `field_name: Type` within class
     bodies
   - **(c) Enum values**: lines matching `VALUE = "literal"` or bare
     `VALUE` entries within enum class bodies
2. Grep the implementation source tree for matching class definitions
3. Compare:
   - Class exists in spec but not impl → finding
   - Class exists in impl but not spec → finding (may be legitimate helper;
     document as Q-IMPL if so)
   - Field name mismatch (present in spec, absent or renamed in impl) →
     finding
   - Enum value mismatch (values differ between spec and impl) → finding

**Severity**: Blocking. All findings must be resolved before the chunk
closes (fix the implementation, update the spec, or document as Q-IMPL).

**What this check doesn't catch**: Semantic drift (field exists but has
wrong meaning), logic drift (algorithm differs but types match), silent
stubbing (function exists but returns dummy data). These require test
execution and reading-comprehension review, which are outside the scope of
an automated grep-level check.

#### Check 2: Traceability Matrix Update

**Input**: `docs/requirements/traceability.md`, the chunk's task list.

**Process**:
1. Identify requirements covered by this chunk: read each task's prose spec
   references → read those spec files' `requires:` frontmatter → collect
   requirement IDs
2. For each requirement ID, check the traceability matrix:
   - **Test** column empty → finding (tests should have been written during
     TDD)
   - **Implementation** column empty → finding (code should exist if the
     task is done)
3. If any column is empty, fill it before proceeding

**Severity**: Blocking. Missing traceability entries must be filled before
the chunk closes. The fill is mechanical — the implementer knows which test
file and source file correspond to each requirement.

#### Check 3: Test Coverage Per Spec

**Input**: Spec files referenced by the chunk's tasks.

**Process**:
1. For each referenced spec, identify the expected implementation module
   (from the spec's design section or by convention: `spec/recon.md` →
   `src/.../recon/`)
2. Search the test directory for test files that import from that module
3. If no test file imports from the module → finding

**Severity**: Advisory. The operator may override with rationale (e.g.,
"tested via integration test in `test_e2e.py`" or "verification task in
next chunk covers this").

#### Check 4: Q-IMPL Audit

**Input**: Implementation code written during this chunk, spec files
referenced by the chunk's tasks.

**Process**:
1. Review implementation decisions made during the chunk
2. For each decision that deviates from spec (different parameter,
   additional field, renamed type, different algorithm step):
   - Check if a Q-IMPL entry exists in the relevant spec's
     `## Implementation Questions` section
   - If no entry exists → finding
3. Undocumented deviations should be added as Q-IMPL entries per the
   deviation protocol (see deviation-protocol.md)

**Severity**: Advisory. The operator may override if the deviation is
trivially obvious (e.g., fixing a typo in a spec identifier). The
override rationale is recorded in the chunk close report.

### Tiered Enforcement

| Check | Severity | On failure |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Type alignment (Check 1) | Blocking | Must fix before closing chunk |
| Traceability update (Check 2) | Blocking | Must fill before closing chunk |
| Test coverage (Check 3) | Advisory | May override with written rationale |
| Q-IMPL audit (Check 4) | Advisory | May override with written rationale |

**Why this split**: Type-name mismatches and missing traceability are
mechanical errors with clear fixes — there's no good reason to carry them
forward. Test coverage gaps and undocumented Q-IMPL entries may have
legitimate reasons (deferred to next chunk, covered by integration tests,
trivially obvious) that warrant operator judgment.

### Chunk Close Report

After running all four checks, `sdd-implement` presents a structured
findings report to the operator:

```markdown
## Chunk N Close Report

### Check 1: Type Alignment
- Status: pass | block
- Findings:
  - [spec.md] Class `Foo` field `bar_id` not found in impl (BLOCK)
  - ...

### Check 2: Traceability
- Status: pass | block
- Findings:
  - REQ-RECON-003: Test column empty (BLOCK)
  - ...

### Check 3: Test Coverage
- Status: pass | advisory
- Findings:
  - recon.md: no test imports from recon/engine.py (ADVISORY)
  - Override rationale: "covered by test_e2e.py integration test"

### Check 4: Q-IMPL Audit
- Status: pass | advisory
- Findings:
  - phase1.md: classify_regime takes config param not in spec (ADVISORY)
  - Override rationale: "added as Q-IMPL-003"

### Summary
- Blocking: 0 remaining (all fixed)
- Advisory: 1 overridden with rationale
- Chunk N: CLOSED
```

The report is presented inline (not persisted as a separate file). Its
purpose is operator confirmation, not archival. The traceability matrix
and Q-IMPL entries themselves are the durable artifacts.

**Why not persist the report**: Chunk close reports are session-specific
confirmation. The findings they check become traceability entries, Q-IMPL
entries, or code fixes — all of which are durable artifacts. Persisting the
report adds files nobody reads after the first session (validated by rubric
M1 rework prompt experience — see RS-002).

### Integration with sdd-implement

The chunk close checklist integrates into `sdd-implement`'s existing
process at the boundary between chunks:

1. Complete all tasks in chunk N
2. Run existing per-task verification (build + lint + type-check + tests)
3. **NEW**: Run chunk close checklist (checks 1-4)
4. Present chunk close report to operator
5. Resolve all blocking findings
6. Record advisory overrides with rationale
7. Report chunk N as closed
8. Proceed to chunk N+1

The existing "Step 4: Milestone Checkpoints" in `sdd-implement` remains
for delivery milestones (M1, M2, etc.) — those are broader checkpoints
where the operator approves proceeding to the next milestone. Chunk close
is more granular and runs more frequently.

## Verification

### Automated
- Verify `sdd-implement` SKILL.md contains chunk close checklist steps
- Verify the checklist references all four checks by name
- Verify tiered enforcement rules are documented (blocking vs advisory)
- Verify chunk identification pattern (`### Chunk N:`) is documented

### Manual
- Run `sdd-implement` against a plan with explicit chunk headers
- Complete a chunk; verify checklist runs before chunk close
- Introduce a deliberate type-name mismatch; verify it blocks
- Introduce a missing traceability entry; verify it blocks
- Introduce a test coverage gap; verify advisory with override option

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Chunk close checkpoint runs after all tasks in a chunk (REQ-CHKC-001)
- [ ] Type alignment check extracts classes, fields, and enums from spec code blocks (REQ-CHKC-002)
- [ ] Traceability check verifies Test and Implementation columns (REQ-CHKC-003)
- [ ] Test coverage check verifies at least one test file per spec (REQ-CHKC-004)
- [ ] Q-IMPL audit flags undocumented deviations (REQ-CHKC-005)
- [ ] Type alignment and traceability are blocking; test coverage and Q-IMPL are advisory (REQ-CHKC-006)
- [ ] Chunk close report lists each check with status and findings (REQ-CHKC-007)
- [ ] Chunks are identified by `### Chunk N: <name>` headers in the plan (REQ-CHKC-008)
