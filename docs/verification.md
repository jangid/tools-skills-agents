  RS-006 implement-stage fan-out (Design B) for sdd-orchestrate —
  REQ-ORCH-015/016 and REQ-ORCH-022..028. Verifies the fan-out behavior added to
  skills/sdd-orchestrate/SKILL.md and skills/sdd-orchestrate/references/fan-out.md,
  plus the doc/requirement reconciliation that removed the "no fan-out" framing.

# Verification Report — Implement-Stage Fan-out (RS-006 / Design B)

## Summary

Holistic verification of the implement-stage fan-out feature (Design B,
orchestrator-owned, one level deep) added to `sdd-orchestrate`. This is a
Markdown-skill deliverable, so quality gates are **structural** — all 7 pass.
Every fan-out acceptance criterion (REQ-ORCH-015/016 and 022..028 — **14** spec
criteria, plus 1 supporting assertion) was walked against the implementation
files with evidence; **all pass**. No other `sdd-*` skill was modified
(REQ-ORCH-001 holds), no stale "no fan-out" strings remain in user-facing files,
and the prior RS-005 report is preserved as `docs/verification-rs005.md`.
**Status: pass — ready to ship.** Zero critical, zero minor issues.

The dispatch-concurrency uncertainty (REQ-ORCH-028) was resolved by the RS-006
spike (`docs/spikes/dispatch-concurrency.md`, 2026-06-05) at **medium**
confidence; the design holds whether dispatches run concurrently or serialized
(correctness is unaffected — only wall-clock speedup is at stake), and the
downstream prose correctly attributes the speedup to the spike's *observed*
result rather than asserting it as established fact.

## Quality Gates (structural — no language compilers apply)

| Gate | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Frontmatter valid | pass | `SKILL.md` frontmatter (`name`, `description`) parses; spec/requirements/spike/traceability frontmatter all parse |
| Skill name kebab-case + matches dir | pass | `name: sdd-orchestrate` == directory `skills/sdd-orchestrate/` |
| SKILL.md size budget | pass | 332 lines (< ~500 guideline); bulky procedure offloaded to `references/fan-out.md` (224 lines) per REQ-ORCH-019 |
| Internal references resolve | pass | `references/fan-out.md` exists (10,875 bytes) and is linked twice from SKILL.md (lines 213, 285); `references/dispatch-templates.md` also resolves |
| Code fences balanced | pass | SKILL.md: 2 fences (even); fan-out.md: 12 fences (even) |
| No other `sdd-*` skill modified (REQ-ORCH-001) | pass | `git diff --name-only` (working tree) and `git diff 795db56~1..HEAD` (all fan-out commits since RS-006) show only `skills/sdd-orchestrate/*` under `skills/`; no `sdd-implement` or any other skill touched |
| No stale "no fan-out" / "sequential only" strings | pass | grep over `skills/sdd-orchestrate/`, `README.org`, `docs/requirements/functional/orchestration.md` returns NONE; REQ-ORCH-020/021 reworded, USAGE.md §8 and README.org lines 39–41 describe active opt-in fan-out |

## Acceptance Criteria — Fan-out cluster

Walked against `skills/sdd-orchestrate/SKILL.md` (SKILL) and
`skills/sdd-orchestrate/references/fan-out.md` (FANOUT).

| Criterion (REQ) | Status | Evidence |
|-----------------|--------|----------|
| Sequential is default; non-opted-in implement runs single-threaded in main (ORCH-015) | pass | SKILL §Execution Model L204–206 "Sequential is the default … unless the operator explicitly opts into fan-out"; §Rules L324 |
| Boundary = independent chunk-dependency branches, not per-milestone/per-task; derived by reading graph without modifying `sdd-implement`; applies only when ≥2 independent branches (ORCH-016) | pass | SKILL §Boundary derivation L222–228; FANOUT §1 L17–34; "never by modifying `sdd-implement`"; degrade-to-sequential when <2 branches |
| Independence parsed from `**Depends on**: Chunk N` / `Entry criteria: Chunk N complete` prose, NOT milestone Entry/Exit; degrade to sequential if unparseable (ORCH-016) | pass | SKILL L225–227 parse `**Depends on**` field or chunk-level prose, "Do not use milestone-level Entry/Exit"; FANOUT §1 L26–31 + §1 degrade conditions L36–44 |
| Orchestrator-owned, one level deep; each subagent a leaf, no sub-dispatch; Design A ruled out infeasible (ORCH-022) | pass | SKILL §Execution Model L208–218 "orchestrator-owned and one level deep", "leaf", "Design A … ruled out infeasible — no subagent-dispatch tool (RS-006 Q1)"; FANOUT §intro L9–13, §2 leaf clause L73–76 |
| One git worktree/branch per concurrently-runnable group; each implement subagent pinned to its worktree/branch (ORCH-023) | pass | SKILL §Lifecycle step 1–2 L250–259; FANOUT §3a L125–133 `git worktree add -b <branch> <path> <base>`; §2 worktree-pin HARD boundary L68–72 |
| Fan-out opt-in at implement gate, never automatic; declining runs sequentially (ORCH-024) | pass | SKILL §Opt-in gate L234–239 "opt-in at the implement gate and never automatic … Absent an opt-in, runs sequentially" |
| Single-chain / no parseable deps → orchestrator tells operator at gate it degrades to sequential (ORCH-024) | pass | SKILL §Opt-in gate L241–244; FANOUT §1 L42–44 "tell the operator at the gate" |
| After merge, orchestrator removes worktree + deletes branch, no orphans (ORCH-023/Q-REQ-G) | pass | SKILL §Lifecycle step 5 L268–270 `git worktree remove` + `git branch -d`; FANOUT §3d L196–207 (incl. redo worktrees torn down) |
| After returns, branches merged sequentially into `main`; all merges complete before implement-stage review runs on merged state (ORCH-025) | pass | SKILL §Lifecycle step 4 L264–267; FANOUT §3b L135–148 "completing all merges before the implement-stage review runs (review sees merged state, never an unmerged branch)" |
| On non-clean conflict: `git merge --abort` + redo; auto-resolve optional/best-effort; clean auto-resolve = PASS; already-merged work never corrupted (ORCH-026) | pass | SKILL §Conflict handling L273–285; FANOUT §3c steps 1–2,4 L150–190 "optional best-effort auto-resolve … else `git merge --abort` … unwinds only the single failing merge" |
| Redo by re-derivation in worktree re-branched from updated `main` (re-run `sdd-implement`), NOT replaying stale patch (ORCH-026, Q-IMPL-1) | pass | SKILL L276–281 "redo the chunk-group by re-derivation … Never replay the stale returned patch"; FANOUT §3c step 2 L161–171 `git worktree add -b <branch>-redo <path> main`, re-dispatch leaf, re-run `sdd-implement` |
| Repeat conflict after re-derivation → boundary error → fall back to sequential, guaranteeing termination (ORCH-026) | pass | SKILL L281–283; FANOUT §3c step 3 L177–185 "still conflicts … proves not truly independent … fall back to running affected groups sequentially … guarantees termination" |
| Fan-out subagents commit with inline `git -c user.email=… -c user.name=…`; no subagent writes shared `.git/config` (ORCH-027) | pass | SKILL §Lifecycle step 3 L260–263; FANOUT §2 commit-identity block L78–84 + §intro template L79; "Writing the main repo's .git/config is blocked by the sandbox" |
| Dispatch-concurrency resolved by RS-006 spike; observed concurrent at medium confidence; correctness unaffected; speedup attributed to observed (not asserted) result (ORCH-028) | pass | SKILL §Concurrency note L288–296 cites `docs/spikes/dispatch-concurrency.md`, "medium confidence", "Correctness does not depend on it"; FANOUT §2 concurrency note L109–115; spike file finding (medium confidence) corroborates |
| Fan-out available ONLY at implement stage; no other stage fans out (ORCH-015 supporting assertion, not a distinct spec checkbox) | pass | SKILL §Execution Model L205–206, §What This Is L37–39 "every other stage is always sequential", §Rules L324–326 |

**All 14 spec criteria pass (+1 supporting assertion).**

## Manual-Verification Bullet Coverage (spec §Verification → Manual)

The spec's fan-out Manual bullets (orchestration.md L499–526) are each satisfied
by inspectable prose/commands in SKILL.md or fan-out.md: opt-in with ≥2 branches
(one worktree/leaf per group), decline/single-chain → sequential, inline `git -c`
identity (no `.git/config`), sequential-merge-before-review on merged state,
per-merge teardown, conflict abort → redo-by-re-derivation, repeat-conflict →
sequential fallback, and single-chain degrade notice at the gate. Live end-to-end
fan-out execution was not run (expensive/stateful — explicitly bounded in the
plan's Risks); the load-bearing mechanisms (subagent dispatch, worktree create,
sequential conflict-aborting merge) carry live RS-006 spike evidence, and the
dispatch template is constructed and inspectable.

## Traceability Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Every fan-out REQ has a Spec | pass (REQ-ORCH-015/016/022..028 → orchestration.md) |
| Every fan-out REQ has an Implementation | pass (SKILL.md + references/fan-out.md) |
| Test column | empty by design — a prose skill has no unit-test surface; the acceptance-criteria walkthrough is the verification (matches RS-005/RS-004 precedent) |
| Verified column | updated to `pass` for REQ-ORCH-016 and REQ-ORCH-022..028 (REQ-ORCH-015 was already `pass`) |

## Regressions

- None found. The working-tree diff touches only `README.org`,
  `docs/requirements/functional/orchestration.md`,
  `docs/requirements/traceability.md`, `docs/spec/orchestration.md`, and the two
  `skills/sdd-orchestrate/` files (SKILL.md, USAGE.md). No existing `sdd-*` skill
  or any spec other than the orchestration spec was modified; `sdd-implement` is
  untouched, satisfying REQ-ORCH-001.

## Issues Found

### Critical (blocks release)
- None.

### Minor (can ship, fix later)
- None.

## Recommendation
- [x] Ship as-is
- [ ] Fix critical issues then ship (invoke sdd-replan)
- [ ] Significant rework needed (invoke sdd-replan)

All structural gates pass and all 14 fan-out acceptance criteria pass with
file-and-line evidence. The active plan may now be archived to
`docs/plan-history/` if desired. Optional highest-fidelity follow-up (operator's
choice): a live DISCUSS→DONE run exercising a real ≥2-branch fan-out plan,
deliberately deferred here as expensive/stateful per the plan's Risks.
